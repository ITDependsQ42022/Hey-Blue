# Launch Retail Stores And Municipality from Hey Blue App, as external Independent Sites

## Context and Problem Statement

HeyBlue App should host Retail Store & Municipality sites with their catalogs of merchandise, so that HeyBlue Members can select Merchandise and redeem points towards purchases. Members can also visit Municipality pages within HeyBlueApp and use their points towards their fines/Penalties. What is the best way for HeyBlue App to integrate with these external Entities?

## Considered Options

* Should HeyBlue delegate & launch these external sites, allowing the sites to manage the shopping and fee/penalty payments thenselves
* Should HeyBlue App own creation of StoreFront & Municaipality Pages.


## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "HeyBlue should delegate & launch these external sites and let the sites manage the shopping and fee/penalty payments thenselves", because HeyBlue does not need to understand the Storefront's Business Model, build/maintain their pages & functionalities.

* Good, because Integration is Simple with delegation Model
* Bad, because Storefronts/Municipalities that dont have existing e-commerce sites may hesitate to partner with HeyBlue 
* … <!-- numbers of pros and cons can vary -->

###  Option 2: HeyBlue App should own creation of StoreFront & Municaipality Pages

{example | description | pointer to more information | …}

* Good, because it promotes ease-of-onboarding for storefronts that dont have existing e-commerce sites
* Bad, becuase of the complexity it adds to the App
* Bad, because upload/maintenance/shipping of catalogued products would have to be understood/maintained. 
* Bad, because Cost of creating/maintaining this may outweigh the value of this approach ( Not verified yet )
