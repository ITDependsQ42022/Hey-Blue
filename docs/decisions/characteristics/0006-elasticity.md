# Elasticity as a Core Architectural Characteristic

## Context and Problem Statement

This characteristic is related to that of affordability, but it also stands on it's own. Usage of Hey Blue! will be occasional per individual with some event based bursts. Furthermore, until it grows usage geographically, there will be large periods of time where the Interactions aspects of the system will not be in use at all. Given this, the system should be able to scale to zero in times of non-use and scale up to occasional and burst usage without issue.
