# Affordability as a Core Architectural Characteristic

## Context and Problem Statement

Hey Blue! is a non-profit organization and does not have a large budget. As such it is imperative to keep costs low.

## Decision Drivers

- Hey Blue! is a non-profit
- Business model relies on a long tail of continued engagement by all members (Civilian, Officer, Business and Charity)

## Decision Outcome

Because of the documented problem statement and drivers, affordability is a core characteristic of Hey Blue!

### Consequences

Cost to build, operate and support the system must be considered carefully with analysis performed to validate.

#### Build

- Buy vs. Build
  -- Packaged software licensing costs
  -- Open-source people cost to build

#### Operate

- Infrastructure operational cost
- People cost to run operations

#### Support

- Cost of support contracts must be considered
- On the other hand cost of hiring SMEs must be considered

## Fitness Functions

Fitness functions for affordability depend on Architectural Style decisions. Therefore documenting these are deferred to and will be included in that decision
