## Security

Security of the application and user data protection 

## Affordability

Hey Blue! is a non-profit organization and does not have a large budget. As such it is imperative to keep costs low.

## Usability 

As called out in the requirements, the Civilian and Officer experience is paramount for Hey Blue! We need to ensure we convey the value of engaging with Hey Blue!, including turning on Location Services. Hey Blue! is nothing without engagement, and Usability feeds into improving engagement

## Elasticity 

This characteristic is related to that of affordability, but it also stands on it's own. Usage of Hey Blue! will be occasional per individual with some event based bursts. Furthermore, until it grows usage geographically, there will be large periods of time where the Interactions aspects of the system will not be in use at all. Given this, the system should be able to scale to zero in times of non-use and scale up to occasional and burst usage without issue.

## Evolvability

There are some core use cases documented in the Requirements that the system must support. However there are also discussions of potential for the future. This includes things like:
 1. Connection to Municipalities to support redemption of points
 2. Connection to 3rd party social media systems
 3. Connection to 3rd party systems for Business Catalogs

## Observability

Hey Blue! must have good Observability with correlation across the typical three pillars (Logging, Metrics and Tracing) as well as the often overlooked Events.

## Availability

Much of Hey Blue! usage will be occasional. If the system is not available when the community tries to interact, then we will lose users. For this reason, availability is a core characteristic.
