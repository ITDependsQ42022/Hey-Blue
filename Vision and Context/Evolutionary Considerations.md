## Evolutionary Architectural Considerations

### Landing Page Feed

To offer maximum value to users with intent of logging on the app and turning on their location, we could start showing retailers within "certain distance" on the HeyBlue! landing page of a citizen. With a focus on call to action,  We can apply ML here to continously customise the feed of the retailers/charities on the page. With the ability to understand their preferences/choice of retailers, we can apply algorithms to improve the feed. 

We could also allow civilians and police officers to have an option of "Not interested" on any suggested retailers which can be used to improve the content on the feed of the landing page. 


### SOS for Vulnerables

Provide a built in panic button. 
If the location service is turned on, Not only to a connected police officer but it can avail emergency medical services by sending a panic signal.
