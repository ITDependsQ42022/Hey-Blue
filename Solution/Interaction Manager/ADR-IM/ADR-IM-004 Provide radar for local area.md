## Context and Problem Statement
The interaction management system requires a member of the community and an officer to interact.

As such the profile manager will need to identify the users as a member or an officer.  However the privacy and identification of individuals must be protected.

## Decision Drivers
There are a number of options for the map display as described below:

<style>
table {
    border-collapse: collapse;
}
table, th, td {
   border: none;
}
</style>

## Decision

The decision is to use a radar image over a precise map:
