status: draft

deciders: Shari

## Context and Problem Statement
The interaction management system requires a member of the community and an officer to interact.

As such the profile manager will need to identify the users as a member or an officer.  However the privacy and identification of individuals must be protected.

## Decision Drivers
There are a number of options for the map display as described below:

<style>
td, th {
   border: none!important;
}
</style>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>![](./radar1.png)</td>
	<td>![](./radar2.png)</td>
	<td>![](./radar3.png)</td>
  </tr>
</table>​​​

## Decision
The recommendation is to locate the citizens for the reason that any tracking of police officers is inadvisable.
The decision is to use a radar image over a precise map:
