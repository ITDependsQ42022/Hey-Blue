## Context and Problem Statement
The interaction management system requires a member of the community and an officer to interact.

As such the profile manager will need to identify the users as a member or an officer.  However the privacy and identification of individuals must be protected.

## Decision Drivers
There are a number of options for the map display as described below:

	<td>![image info](./radar3.png)</td>
  </tr>
</table>​​​
